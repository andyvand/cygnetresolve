# netresolve library and tools

## Core features

 * File descriptor based nonblocking host/service name resolution API
   - suitable for various file descriptor based event loops
   - unlike glibc or POSIX APIs
 * Extensible request and result APIs
   - unlike glibc or POSIX APIs
 * Backend-based network name resolution similar to that one found in glibc's nsswitch
   - configurable backend options
   - unlike DNS-only libraries
 * Avoids limitations and bugs found in glibc
   - support for ifindex/scope\_id (problematic in nsswitch)
   - support for TTL information (problematic in nsswitch)
 * DNS happy eyeballs implementation
   - concurent A/AAAA requests
   - quick timeout when there's no answer to one of A/AAAA requests
 * Socket API
   - resolver-based wrappers over `bind()` and `connect()`
 * TCP happy eyeballs implementation
   - concurrent IPv4/IPv6 connect
   - quick timeout when there's no answer to one of IPv4/IPv6 TCP SYN packets

## Basic API

The application creates a resolver instance using `netresolve_open()`, optionally performs additional configuration, and then calls `netresolve_resolve()` and uses retrieve the result using `netresolve_get_*()` functions. Without additional steps the basic API is blocking.

## Callback-based (asynchronous) API

How to use it:

 * Create a handle using `netresolve_open()` (as with basic API)
 * Register callbacks using `netresolve_callback_set_watch_fd()` and/or `netresolve_set_callbacks()`.
 * Start name resolution using `netresolve_resolve()`.
 * Run (or continue running) the event loop calling `netresolve_dispatch()` for file descriptor events.
 * Close the handle using `netresolve_close()` (as with basic API)

What should the callbacks do:

 * The `watch_fd()` callback is there to register the netresolve's file descriptors
 * The `on_success()` callback is called when the name resolution finished without error.
 * The `on_failure()` callback is called when the name resolution failed.

Registering the `watch_fd()` callback switches netresolve into nonblocking (aka asynchronous) mode. It is responsible for registering file descriptors and expected events with the application's event loop. The application is responsible for adding, modifying or removing the file descriptor event set whenever `watch_fd()` is called.

Implementation notes:

The current implementation only registers *one* file descriptor with the application. The file descriptor is an *epoll* file descripter and the associated event is allways `POLLIN`. It's used for tracking the file descriptors that are attached to it and can be used with `select()`, `poll()` as well as `epoll()`. On platforms without *epoll*, a similar mechanism can be used if available or the individual backend file descriptors can be conveyed to the application for use with standard `select()`, `poll()` and similar. A portable application shouldn't rely

## POSIX-style API

If your program doesn't need the full power of the provided API but you still want to use `netresolve` as your resolver implementation, you can simply link your program to `libnetresolve-posix.so` which overrides selected POSIX-style name resolution functions.

Supported functions:

 * `getaddrinfo()`
 * `gethostbyname()`

## Socket API

Support for `socket()`, `bind()` and `connect()` is included. The only thing the application has to do is to register either `on_bind()` or `on_connect()` callback. The resolver is configured with flags suitable for the respective operation. When name resolution is finished, `on_bind()` callback is called for each successfully bound address. The `on_connect()` callback is called once, for the first successfully connected address.

## Tools

The `netresolve` command-line tool can be used for testing the library. The `libnetresolve-getaddrinfo.so` library together with the `tools/wrapper.sh` script can be used to test any programs calling `getaddrinfo()` (see `TODO` for missing features).

## Backends

The list of backends can be chosen using `netresolve_set_backend_string()` or via the `NETRESOLVE_BACKENDS` environment variable. Backends are separated by a comma and accept options separated by a colon. A plus sign prepended to the backend name can be used to run that backend even if another backend already succeeded.

    NETRESOLVE_BACKENDS=any,loopback,numerichost,hosts,dns

### Production backends

Three backends, `any`, `loopback` and `numerichost`, are available that perform trivial translations. The `hosts` backends uses `/etc/hosts` database of nodes. Nonblocking API is most useful for remote services. Currently there's a nonblocking `dns` backend based on the *c-ares* library.

### Testing backends

The `getaddrinfo` backend calls glibc's `getaddrinfo()` to get all the information. The `nss` backend calls glibc's nsswitch backends directly. Both of those backends are blocking as the underlying functions are blocking as well.

    NETRESOLVE_BACKENDS=getaddrinfo ./netresolve www.sourceware.org http

    NETRESOLVE_BACKENDS=nss:files ./netresolve localhost

There's also a nonblocking `exec` backend that calls an executable and feeds it with the serialized request on standard input and expect a serialized response on standard output.

    NETRESOLVE_BACKENDS=exec:/path/to/my/script ./netresolve localhost

## Writing a custom backend

When a name resolution request is ready, netresolve calls `start(resolver, settings)`. Backend's `start()` implementation then has to do one of the following:

1. Add any data items using `netresolve_backend_add_*()` functions and call `netresolve_backend_finished()` to signal that the name resolution has finished and we don't need to run any other backends.
2. Call `netresolve_backend_failed()` to signal failure.
3. Add one or more file descriptors or timers using `netresolve_backend_watch_fd()` and `netresolve_backend_watch_timeout()`. In that case, the backend must also provide the `dispatch()` function so that the transaction can continue.

Input data is gathered using `netresolve_backend_get_*()` functions. Internal state accross `start()` and `dispatch()` calls can be kept using `netresolve_backend_new_priv()` and `netresolve_backend_get_data()`. The backend should provide `cleanup()` function to clean up any resources. It's called by netresolve upon success/failure or when the transaction was cancelled by the application.

### c-ares

They provide `ares_fds()` and `ares_timeout()` to update the current set of file descriptors and the associated timeout. The `netresolve` callback API improves greatly on that. The application submits the `watch_fd()` callback.

### sssd

They provide a backend-based caching service for user/group name resolution, authentication and related stuff. As netresolve doesn't really need to cache its results nor does it need to perform authentication services, it provides just a shared library, not a long-running daemon. Also, for DNS resolution they currently use `c-ares`.

### libevent, squid, etc...

According to the website, libevent is using internal asynchronous DNS as well. The same applies to squid. Apparently the operating system's resolution API is not sufficient for many tools.
